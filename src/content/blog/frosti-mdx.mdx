## Preface

This article describes how to use the components provided by Frosti in `mdx` to realize the functions that can't be realized by normal `md`.

## Main text

### Getting started

First you need to create an `mdx` file, which is as simple as changing the extension to `.mdx`.

### Introducing

The components provided by Frosti are placed in the `/mdx` folders. Write something under the document properties (frontmatter):

```mdx
import Collapse from "../../components/mdx/Collapse.astro";
import Diff from "../../components/mdx/Diff.astro";
import Error from "../../components/mdx/Error.astro";
import Info from "../../components/mdx/Info.astro";
import Kbd from "../../components/mdx/Kbd.astro";
import Success from "../../components/mdx/Success.astro";
import Warning from "../../components/mdx/Warning.astro";
import TimeLine from "../../components/mdx/TimeLine.astro";
import LinkCard from "../../components/mdx/LinkCard.astro";
```

### Example

#### Collapse

<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>

```mdx
<Collapse title="This is an example text.">
  This is the hidden content!
</Collapse>
```

#### Diff

<Diff r="/image/r.png" l="/image/l.png"></Diff>

```mdx
<Diff r="/image/r.png" l="/image/l.png" />
```

#### Error

<Error>Maybe something went wrong?</Error>

```mdx
<Error>Maybe something went wrong? </Error>
```

#### Warning

<Warning>Hey! Watch out for potholes! </Warning>

```mdx
<Warning>Hey! Watch out for potholes! </Warning>
```

#### Message

<Info>It's just a message. </Info>

```mdx
<Info>It's just a message. </Info>
```

#### Success

<Success>Congratulations on your successful deployment! </Success>

```mdx
<Success>Congratulations on your successful deployment! </Success>
```

#### Kbd

<Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy the text.

```mdx
<Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>C</Kbd> to copy the text.
```

#### TimeLine

<TimeLine
  items={[
    { year: "1984", event: "First Macintosh computer" },

    { year: "2001", event: "iPod" },
    { year: "2007", event: "iPhone" },
    { year: "2015", event: "Apple Watch" },
